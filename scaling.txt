Most of the informaation we require to move this project into something more modular is in data.pth. 
Creating a basic webpage, we can build a simple page with a form that takes in user input. With bootstrap or 
something similar, we can set up a text box beneath our form to render the responses from the bot or create 
dynamic routes that take us to a display page for each response. Next we simply add in some form validation to
ensure that users are not able to input any code or text that would break the bot, add some styling, and deploy. 
For a bot that's even simpler than what we've done here, i would suggest using flask and one of the many 
chatbot specific librairies that you can find and import.
